# moleculaRnetworks

*moleculaRnetworks* is a bundled series of scripts, written in the software package R, for processing molecular simulations data. These scripts are intended for the frame-by-frame geometric and solvent network analysis of aqueous solutes only. The algorithms contained therein are based on graph theory and contain a novel method for identifying the geometric shape adopted by the solvent in the immediate vicinity of the solute, as well as an exploratory approach for describing H-bonding, based on the PageRank algorithm implemented by the Google search engine. The *moleculaRnetworks* codes include a preprocessor which distills simulation trajectories into physicochemical data arrays, and an interactive analysis script that enables statistical, trend, correlation analyses and other data mining.
